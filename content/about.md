## Who are we
Reading Representation began as a response to the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020. We are a group of Washington County parents who believe in the power of literature to educate, inspire, and build the next generation. 

## What we believe
We believe in the power of story to challenge stereotypes, promote empathy, equality and racial justice. We believe all children should have access to books featuring characters they can relate to, who look like them and reflect stories of joy, empathy and equality. We also seek to promote anti-racist books that accurately reflect history and celebrate black and brown lives. 

We acknowledge that books featuring Black and Brown characters are less readily available, and want to support the effort to bring books that promote equality and justice to community organizations serving low-income communities.

## What we do
We prioritize purchasing books from Black owned bookstores, and partner with community organizations to distribute books to children who need them most.
