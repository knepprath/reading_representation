## Who are we
We are a group of Portland Metro area parents who love books and want all children to have books that inspire and celebrate diversity.

## What we believe
We believe all children should have access to books with characters that reflect the diversity of our world. All children should have access to books that they can relate to, who look like them, and reflect stories of joy, empathy and equality. 

We recognize that books featuring Black and Brown characters are less readily available, and want to support the effort to bring books that celebrate these identities into the community. 

We believe in partnering with community organizations serving youth and low-income communities to distribute books. 

## What we do
We raise funds for books, prioritize purchasing books from Black owned bookstores, and partner with community organizations to distribute books to children who need them most.
