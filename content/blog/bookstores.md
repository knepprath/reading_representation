To date, we have been placing orders with the Black owned book store **[Ashay By The Bay](https://ashaybythebay.com)**. 

Lithub has a great **[list of Black owned bookstores](https://lithub.com/you-can-order-today-from-these-black-owned-independent-bookstores/)**

If you have a favorite black owned bookstore we can support, let us know: **<readingrepresentation@gmail.com>**.
