Reading Representation has donated books to Community Partners for Affordable Housing's after school programs and ____. We hope to raise funds to support additional community organizations including early childhood/head start programs, youth programs, and more. This effort is 100% volunteer run, so 100% of donations go towards the purchase of new books.
